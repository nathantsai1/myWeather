# 'the good weather App'

## description
This app(it's actually a website) gives the weather, pulling information from three APIs to:
1. take all cities with the name of inputted site(taken from a 'POST' form with a text input), taking the Longitude, Latitude, city, and state/country. the name of this API was the 'geocacher', so to speak, was the openweathermap.com, which gave out small time information for free.
2. take the weather from openweathermap, just the one day.
3. take the 5 day forecast from openweathermap, to edit and send back to the hdmi templates
